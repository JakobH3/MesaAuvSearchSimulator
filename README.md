# MesaAuvSearchSimulator
This file uses the Python Mesa Agent Based Modeling Library to create an optimal search path for an Autonomus Underwater Vehicle (AUV) looking 
for a downed Airliner. The file consists of two main parts the Airplane agent and the AUV agent. The Airplane agent simulates the path of an unpiloted 
aircraft and then generates a probability map of landing locations. The AUV agent takes this probability map and generates an optimal search path.
